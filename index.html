                UK and US naval forces have repelled the largest attack yet by Yemen's Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea, the UK defence secretary says.

                The Iran-backed group launched at least 21 drones and missiles overnight, according to the US military.

                They were shot down by carrier-based jets and four warships, it added. No injuries or damage were reported.

                The Houthis have not commented, but they have targeted vessels in response to the war in the Gaza Strip.

                They have claimed - often falsely - that the ships were linked to Israel.

                The US military's Central Command said Tuesday's attack was the 26th since 19 November.

                At around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT), Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen towards international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea, it added.

                Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond.
